# SSDI Project

Our web application is intended to be used by people who are interested in different types of sports and like to buy new equipments. Its a C2C application where the transaction of products is happening between different customers and no dedicated seller/supplier is required. Customers would be trading different types of sports equipment with each other. The purpose for trading can be anything, it can be their love towards any sport, it can be finding any equipment that is rare or can be due to their habit of collecting different sports item. No other type of payment is allowed, its like a barter system where you trade with whatever you have and get what others have.

Users can create their profile and then they can login to start trading. There will be a page for registration and login and there will be a page where users can see what they can trade and then they can send request for trading. A trade would be completed if the other person accepts the trade.
